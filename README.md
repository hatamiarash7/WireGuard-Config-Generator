This simple script will generate tunnel config files for WireGuard.

## How to use

You need to give two file contains your information:

- `endpoints.toml` : Contains the endpoints you want to connect to ( Name, Address ).
- `ip-list.toml` : Contains the IP addresses you want to use.

And also give private/other information as a `.env` file.

### endpoints.toml

```toml
Company-Server-1 = "wg-1.domain.xyz:1234"
Company-Server-2 = "wg-2.domain.xyz:1234"
```

### ip-list.toml

```toml
[k8s]
DC1 = "1.2.3.4/32"
DC2 = "5.6.7.8.9/32"
DC3 = "1.2.3.4/27"

[monitoring]
prometheus = "1.2.3.4/32"
grafana = "5.6.7.8.9/32"

[other]
server1 = "1.2.3.4/32"
server2 = "5.6.7.8.9/32"
server3 = "1.2.3.4/27"
```

### .env

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=
PUBLIC_KEY=
ADDRESS=
MTU=
PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVE=
```

> **Note**: If you need extra data than the above, you should add your variables in `main.py` too.

## Run

To generate config files for all endpoints, run:

```bash
make run
```

This script will create file(s) based on the given endpoints. In this example, it will create `Company-Server-1.conf` and `Company-Server-2.conf` files like this:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <PRIVATE_KEY>
Address = <ADDRESS>
MTU = <MTU>

[Peer]
PublicKey = <PUBLIC_KEY>
Endpoint = wg-1.domain.xyz:1234
AllowedIPs = 1.2.3.4/32, 5.6.7.8/32, ...
PersistentKeepalive = <PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVE>
```

Now, you can import all generated configs in WireGuard.
